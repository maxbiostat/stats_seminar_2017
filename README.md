# Bayesian time-trees
my talk at the [Statistics seminar](http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/events/statistics) at the School of Mathematics, University of Edinburgh.

[[SLIDES]](https://github.com/maxbiostat/stats_seminar_2017/blob/master/2017_LMCarvalho_MCMC_Phylo.pdf)

This talk is about the [transition kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_kernel) we developed for [BEAST](http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/).
I spend the first half of the talk motivating Bayesian phylogenetics and providing some background.
In the second half I move on to discuss our approach and show some results on small data sets.

If this is up your alley, you might want to take a look at some of the [animations](https://github.com/maxbiostat/stats_seminar_2017/blob/master/animations/sampling_trees.md) I've put together to illustrate MCMC on trees. 

For this talk I have stolen figures and/or slides from:
